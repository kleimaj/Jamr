JAMR SWIPING

The home page of Jamr is the swiping page, this is where you can "like" or "dislike" potential
musical matches. By liking a match, they will be notified that you have taken an interest in 
them. They now have the option to send you a message and maybe meet up to jam!

MESSAGING PAGE

The second menu is the messaging page. This is where you can message connections and remove 
them. If you discover a match is not what you want, you can remove them. 

PROFILE PAGE

The final menu is the profile menu. This page allows you to set your personal information,
media, and searching preferences. Carefully crafting a bio and using good search prefernces
can help you find the next musician for your band!

Enjoy Jamr!
